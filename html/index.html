    <p align="center">  My name is Noah Henderson, I hate school. I have two brothers names Joshua and Caleb, they are 9 years old. When I was little i always wanted to be a Police officer. In todays society i donâ€™t see that being  possible career option for the future. No matter what you do, police will be made out the be the bad guys whether video evidence shows it to be false or not. Coding isn't my thing because I hate sitting there and typing on a computer.
       My goals in life are to pass school and get a job to support myself. I have to find somewhere to live when I turn 18. My dad days he will kick me out of the house. Ending up homeless is not on my to-do list. I guess worst scenario I can live in a box. I can find a job soon after that.</p>
